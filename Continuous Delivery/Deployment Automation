Today, we started to use deployment automation pipelines for our IBB Singlenode and Prod Helm chart release deployments.(mpower, mpay, mbattery, etc...)
It is a milestone for our Continuous Delivery/Deployment Automation process.
We are utilizing the advantages of the approaches such as:
- GitOps
- Single source of trurth
- Push-Button deployments with the approvements
- Robust collaborative working opportunity with the files on the Repo
- Central orchestration

In this way we have faster, more reliable,repatable and straightforward deployment processes.
As of now, we do not have to use we a static location. So, we can deploy the releases without location dependency
Beyond that, we can reduce deployment risks, and time.
We can get the trace of whole process steps historically.
